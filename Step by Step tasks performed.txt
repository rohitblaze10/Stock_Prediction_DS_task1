Hello, everyone! I'm thrilled to introduce our stock prediction project, Task 1, which I completed for Bharat Intern. This project is all about using the incredible power of machine learning to forecast stock prices and help us make smarter investment choices.

Now, let me give you a quick rundown of the key features:

First off, we have robust data preprocessing scripts. They're designed to clean up data, normalize it, and take care of any missing values. This ensures that our machine learning models get top-notch data to work with.

Next up is feature engineering. We've implemented some clever techniques that extract meaningful insights from financial data, creating strong predictors for stock price movements.

And speaking of models, we've got quite the lineup. You can explore a variety of machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and more.

But it doesn't stop there. We're all about evaluating these models. We use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-Squared (R2) to figure out which model performs the best.

Ever wondered how different models compare? We've got you covered. Our project allows you to put different models side by side to understand their strengths and weaknesses in stock prediction.

And of course, the real magic happens when you use these trained models to forecast future stock prices. Visualize the predictions and gain valuable insights into potential market movements.

We've also made sure our project is user-friendly with interactive plots and visualizations that help you make sense of the model outputs.

For those who want to stay up-to-date, we even demonstrate how to fetch real-time stock data using APIs and feed it to the models for live predictions.

Whether you're new to machine learning or a seasoned data scientist, our repository offers a wealth of resources to enhance your skills in stock market prediction. We're all about collaboration, so we welcome contributions, feedback, and ideas from the open-source community to keep improving our models.

So, let's embark on this exciting journey of stock prediction with machine learning! Dive into our repository, and start making more informed investment decisions today. Happy forecasting!
